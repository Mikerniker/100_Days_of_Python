# Day 77 Computation with Numpy and N-dimensional Arrays


## Overview

- Topics: Numpy


### The challenge

- Use Numpy to create and generate arrays, analyse the shape and dimensions of a ndarray, slice and subset a ndarray based on its indices
- Do linear algebra like operations with scalars and matrix multiplication
- Use NumPys broadcasting to make ndarray shapes compatible
- Manipulate images in the form of ndarrays
