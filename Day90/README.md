## Reflection
**Approach & Challenges:** 
I created the design first and then implemented the logic afterward. This approach allowed me to visualize the user interface before working on the functionality. Implementing the timer with event binding was challenging, and I had to use ChatGPT to help with some parts where I got stuck.

**Biggest learning:**
The biggest learning was reviewing Tkinter concepts and understanding more how event handling works.The design was easier to do. I also had to look up some concepts, such as how to change the appearance of widgets and buttons and aligning the buttons in one column using the Frame widget. 

**Future Improvements:**
If I were to tackle this project again, I might try creating a web version instead of using Tkinter.
