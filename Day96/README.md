## Overview
- Topics:  Pandas, Streamlit, JSON, Python, HTTP request, and REST APIs

### The challenge

## Reflection
**Approach, Challenges, Learnings, and Future Improvements:**
This was a practice project to review Streamlit and working with APIs. Since I'm new to crypto, I wasn’t fully confident in evaluating the actual data and quality (e.g., top gainers and losers), but accuracy wasn’t my main goal- my focus was understanding how to pull and display data in a web app.

I also used ChatGPT to help refactor parts of the code and make it cleaner. Along the way, I reviewed:
- Working with nested JSON and dictionaries
- Using pandas for data processing
- Formatting numeric values with :.2f

Things I’d improve in the future:
- Add user interactivity (filters, date selection, etc.)
- Improve error handling
- Add better visualizations (e.g., charts)

## Notes/Concepts/Review: 
- Reviewing accessing dictionaries `my_dict.get('key', default_value)`
- `:.2f` format a floating-point number to two decimal places.
