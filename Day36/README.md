## Overview

### The challenge

- Step 1: Monitor when stock price increases/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday.
- Step 2: Get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME. 
- Step 3: Send a separate message with the percentage change and each article's title and description to your Telegram.  

##### Note:
- The original challenge was to send the message via Twilio, but Telegram was used for this instead.
