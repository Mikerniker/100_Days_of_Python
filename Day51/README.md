#### Notes
- Main.py - was the first attempt to sign in directly with google, but can't get past the two factor authentication with send a message to my phone, so this code is incomplete. This uses undetected_chromedriver to bypass the Google bot check, which works for the most part but is incomplete.
- Main2.py - this signs in with the Twitter login input box and is the complete code to the Day 51 challenge.
