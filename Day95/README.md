## Reflection
**Approach, Challenges, Learnings, and Future Improvements:**
This project was both my favorite and most frustrating one. I repeated it multiple times because I kept getting stuck and confused. Eventually, I decided to start over from scratch -rewatching and reviewing Angela’s videos on the Turtle module and focusing on getting the class structure right.

While the final code isn’t perfect, and game development isn’t really my strength, I did make meaningful progress. I still ran into some issues, but they were more manageable than before. There was more clarity this time around, and the problems I encountered were smaller roadblocks that I could resolve (also thanks in part to ChatGPT).

There’s still a lot of room for improvement: cleaning up and modularizing the code, refining the logic, and making everything more reusable. As for the game itself, I’m not much of a gamer, but there are several ways it could be enhanced: adding sound effects or explosion animations, tracking and displaying levels, introducing power-ups, and creating more variety in the enemies.

The biggest takeaway for me was revisiting and reinforcing everything I’ve previously learned about object-oriented programming. There’s still a lot to digest and review, but I’m genuinely happy that I was able to get the game working in the end—even if it was just a basic implementation.

## Notes/Concepts:
