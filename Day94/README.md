## Reflection
**Approach, Challenges, Learnings, and Future Improvements:** 

## Notes: 
- When starting, raise ImageNotFoundException sometimes happens for `locate_dinosaur` but find that refreshing the page works. 

Future fixes:
1. Code doesn't work when it shifts to night mode
2. Dinosaur doesn't duck when overhead pterodactyl appears though it doesn't appear necessary since the pterodactyl doesn't touch the dinosaurs head.
