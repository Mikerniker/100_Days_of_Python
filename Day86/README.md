## Notes
**Approach**
The project underwent multiple iterations. I encountered frequent challenges, causing the project to take longer than expected. There were recurring moments of confusion and difficulty. Eventually, I decided to completely discard all the previous work and break down it down to smaller steps, which eventually helped me achieve the functionality I wanted.

**Challenges:** 
The most challenging aspect was determining how to compare the words to the user input. In the initial iterations, I overcomplicated the process but later found a simpler implementation.

**Biggest learning:**
There were numerous learning experiences. First, it's important to be cautious if using ChatGPT to get unstuck, sometimes it can add complexity to the code, which further adds to the confusion. I had to review and re-test multiple times. 
I also revisited some concepts, such as the use of ```lambda``` and the ```after``` method, as well as the ```.bind``` function.
The GUI design was the easiest for me, as it aligned most with my interests. Although I achieved a satisfactory result, there is room for improvement in both UI and functionality. In the future, I would explore enhancing the UI/UX by incorporating features like highlighting each words instead of deleting the first word.
