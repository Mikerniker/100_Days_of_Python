## Overview

- Topics: Tkinter, Pandas

### The challenge

- Create a speed typing test using Tkinter to assesses typing speed. Give the user some sample text and detect how many words they can type per minute.

## Notes
**Approach**
The project took longer than expected. Though I approached it by trying to break it down, there were recurring moments of getting stuck and confused by the code I created. Eventually, I decided to completely discard all the previous work and break down it down into even smaller steps, which eventually helped me achieve the functionality I wanted. I had to remind myself that there is the potential for steps to be smaller compared to something that looks small enough.

**Challenges:** 
The most challenging aspect was determining how to compare the words to the user input. In the initial iterations, I overcomplicated the process but later found a simpler implementation.

**Biggest learning:**
There were numerous learning experiences. First, it's important to be cautious if using ChatGPT to get unstuck, sometimes it can add complexity to the code, which further adds to the confusion. I had to review and re-test multiple times. 
I also revisited some concepts, such as the use of ```lambda``` and the ```after``` method, as well as the ```.bind``` function.
The GUI design was the easiest for me, as it aligned most with my interests. Although I achieved a satisfactory result, there is room for improvement in both UI and functionality. In the future, I would explore enhancing the UI/UX by incorporating features like highlighting each words instead of deleting the first word.
