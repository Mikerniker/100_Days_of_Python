### Notes

- 07/26/2023 I was trying to find what the difference in output between request.form and request.form.get is since the output remains the same,  currently it seems they do the same thing just with a different syntax ``` name = request.form['name']``` vs ```name=request.form.get('name')```. Can't seem to find a clear reference explaining the differences between the two for posts requests.
