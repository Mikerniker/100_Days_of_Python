# 100_Days_of_Python

Hello,

This is a repository of my final projects for Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022.
I am currently on Day 36, but slowly putting my finished projects (Days 1-35) into Github for my reference.
I'm still trying to understand Github and how to add files, so this repository is still a mess...will fix it soon!
Thank you for visiting!



## Beginner
**Day 1:**
- Topics:Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manipulation and Variables
- Notes: This is the final project for Day 1 of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022
- Small changes made to the original project, used food instead of pets, and used .capitalize() method.


**Day 2:**
- Topics: Data Types, Numbers, Operations, Type Conversion, f-Strings
- Notes: This is my solution for the Tip Calculator Project
