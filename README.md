Hello,

This is a repository of my final projects for Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022. I am currently on Day (39,40) and 44, but slowly putting my finished projects (Days 1-39) into Github for my reference. I'm still trying to understand Github and how to add files, so this repository is still a work in progress...! Thank you for visiting!
