- Had some initial difficulties with "Not Found The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again." - This happened because the site wasstill running on the previous server so (on Windows) you had to do a ctrl+alt+delete to restart everything. Then the code started working properly.
