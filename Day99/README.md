# Day 99 Professional Portfolio Project: Analyse and Visualise the Space Race

## Overview
- Topics: Python, Pandas  

### The challenge

-  Explore the dataset from nextspaceflight.com, covering all space missions since 1957.
-  Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
-  Analyze and visualize the following questions:
  - Which country/organization launched the most missions in any given year?
  - How has the cost of space missions varied over time?
  - Which months are most popular for launches?
  - Have missions become safer over time, or has the failure rate remained the same?
- Experiment with a variety of chart types for insights (e.g.
 Choropleths,  Sunburst charts, Segmented bar charts, etc.)
- Optional: Formulate new questions from the dataset and investigate them.data exploration, data cleaning, and data visualisation.

## Reflection
**Approach, Challenges, Learnings, and Future Improvements:**
**Approach**
For this project, I chose to use Streamlit instead of Jupyter Notebook to make the analysis more interactive and closer to a real-world application. Streamlit allowed me to explore the data while also presenting insights in a simple web-based interface.

I also used AI-assisted tools (ChatGPT and Claude) to help identify appropriate functions and approaches when I got stuck. Although data science is not my primary interest, this project helped me practice applying core concepts in a practical setting.
