Streamlit App: https://spacerace-mikerniker.streamlit.app/

## Overview
- Topics: Python, Pandas, Streamlit  

### The challenge

-  Explore the dataset from nextspaceflight.com, covering all space missions since 1957.
-  Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
-  Analyze and visualize the following questions:
  - Which country/organization launched the most missions in any given year?
  - How has the cost of space missions varied over time?
  - Which months are most popular for launches?
  - Have missions become safer over time, or has the failure rate remained the same?
- Experiment with a variety of chart types for insights (e.g.
 Choropleths,  Sunburst charts, Segmented bar charts, etc.)
- Optional: Formulate new questions from the dataset and investigate them.data exploration, data cleaning, and data visualisation.

## Reflection
**Approach, Challenges, Learnings, and Future Improvements:**
**Approach**
For this project, I chose to use Streamlit instead of Jupyter Notebook to make the analysis more interactive and closer to a real-world application. Streamlit allowed me to explore the data while also presenting insights in a simple web-based interface.

I also used AI-assisted tools (ChatGPT and Claude) to help identify appropriate functions and approaches when I got stuck. Although data science is not my primary interest, this project helped me practice applying core concepts in a practical setting.

**Challenges**
One of the main challenges was trying to solve the problems independently, especially since some data science concepts are still not fully intuitive to me. At times, I wasn’t 100% confident in my answers.
Another difficulty was translating theoretical concepts into actual code, particularly when deciding which approach or visualization best answered the question being asked.

**Learnings**
This project served as a strong refresher of core data analysis concepts. I revisited several lessons and rewatched parts of Angela Yu’s course to reinforce my understanding. Using Streamlit also helped me think more about how analysis is presented to an end user.

**Future Improvements**

- Improve confidence in data interpretation and validation of results
- Add more explanatory text in the app to clearly communicate insights
- Explore additional visualizations or interactivity in Streamlit
- Refactor parts of the code for better readability and structure
