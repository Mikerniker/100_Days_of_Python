## Debug the Odd or Even Code:
- Fix the bug in the following code:

### ORIGINAL CODE:

```
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?"))

if number % 2 = 0:
    print("This is an even number.")
else:
    print("This is an odd number.")

```

#### My findings: The error was a result of using = (assignment) instead of == (checking for equality). Fixed code is in main.py
