# Day 87 Professional Portfolio Project: Breakout Game 


## Overview

- Topics: Python Turtle

### The challenge

- Using Python Turtle, build a clone of the 80s hit game Breakout. 
- Create eight rows of bricks, with two rows each of a different color. 
- Objective: The player must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to hit a ball against the bricks and eliminate them. If the player's paddle misses the ball's rebound, they will lose a turn. The player has three turns. 
- Scoring: Yellow bricks earn one point each, green bricks earn three points, orange bricks earn five points and red bricks score seven points each.

## Notes
**Approach and Challenges:** 

This project was more manageable compared to the previous one. I broke down the problem into smaller steps and built the game from there. I had to refer and review some of my previous notes for guidance and had to Google some Turtle methods. The most challenging part was implementing the scoring system and coloring the bricks.

**Biggest learning:**

This project helped reinforce my understanding of Python classes and utilizing object-oriented programming principles. If I were to tackle this project again, I would perhaps explore alternative methods for implementing the scoring system and brick differentiation and make the code cleaner.
