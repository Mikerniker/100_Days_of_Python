## Overview

### The challenge

- Exercise: The Great Squirrel Census Data Analysis
  - Use given data census of squirrels and the pandas library to create a csv called "squirrel count", which contains the fur color of squirrels: grey, cinnamon, or black.
  - Figure out how many squirrels there are based on their fur color and create a dataframe for it and output to csv.

- Project: The States Game
  - Create a US States quiz.
  - Use Turtle module and Pandas to read csv files

## My process

### Built with

- Python
- Pandas Library
- Turtle

### What I learned
-Tools: 
- CSV library
  - import csv
  - Reader method, example: `csv.reader(data_file`  reads and output the

- Pandas Library
  - import pandas
  - Method to read csv files, example: `pandas.read_csv("weather_data.csv")`
  - DataFrames and Series

- Turtle only works with gif image files.
- `turtle.mainloop()` - keeps screen open
