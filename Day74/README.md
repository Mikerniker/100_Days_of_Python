# Day 74 Analyze Lego Data Set (Aggregate and Merge Data with Pandas)

## Overview

- Topics: Matplotlib (Create line, bar charts, scatter plot), Use relational databases by using primary and foreign keys, Pandas (.agg(), .groupby(), .merge(), .sort_values(), .value_counts(), .rename()), Python  

### The challenge

- Analyze a LEGO dataset to find the following: 
  - What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?
  - What year were the first LEGO sets released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?
  - Which LEGO theme has the most sets?
  - When did the LEGO company really take-off based on its product offering? How many themes and sets did it release every year?
  - Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?

### Notes

#### Markdown Notes

- The Double-asterisk ** symbol will make text bold.
- Adding images to markdown is possible with HTML. For example: ```<img src="https://i.imgur.com/49FNOHj.jpg">```
- Modify section headings with hashtag # 

#### Panda Notes

- ```.sort_values()``` Sorts in ascending order by default. For example: ```sets.sort_values('year').head()```
- ```sets[sets['year'] == 1949]``` Example of filtering DataFrame on a condition. Retrieving the rows where the year column has the value 1949: sets['year'] == 1949.
- Set the ascending argument to False when we sorting if we want to find the largest number, example: 
```sets.sort_values('num_parts', ascending=False).head()```
- Can combine the groupby() and count() functions to aggregate data
- ```.value_counts()``` function helps find the number of items in a category
- Can slice DataFrames using the square bracket notation e.g., df[:-2] or df[:10]
- Use the ```.agg()``` function to run an operation on a particular column
- ```rename()``` , can rename columns of DataFrames, example ```themes_by_year.rename(columns = {'theme_id':'nr_themes'}, inplace = True)```

- Pandas .agg() function

When you need to summarize data, the .groupby() function comes in handy. However, if you want to run even more operations based on a particular DataFrame column, the .agg() method comes in.
Example: Calculate the number of different themes by calendar year. This means grouping the data by year and then counting the number of unique theme_ids for that year, so chain the .groupby() and the .agg() functions together: ```themes_by_year = sets.groupby('year').agg({'theme_id': pd.Series.nunique})```
- The .agg() method takes a dictionary as an argument. In this dictionary, specify which operation to apply to each column. In the example, calculate the number of unique entries in the theme_id column by the .nunique() method.
```
themes_by_year = sets.groupby('year').agg({'theme_id': pd.Series.nunique})
themes_by_year.rename(columns = {'theme_id':'nr_themes'}, inplace = True)
themes_by_year.head()
themes_by_year.tail()
```
- Use ```.merge()``` DataFrames along a particular column
- Example to find a string withing a column of a database: ```star_wars = themes_df[themes_df['name'] == 'Star Wars']```

#### Matplotlib Notes

- To import matplotlib:
```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

- Can exclude data with slicing, example: 
```plt.plot(sets_by_year.index[:-2], sets_by_year.set_num[:-2])```

- To create a line chart: ```plt.plot(x, y)```
- To create a scatter plot: ```plt.scatter(x, y)``` 
- To create a bar chart: ```plt.bar(x, y)```
