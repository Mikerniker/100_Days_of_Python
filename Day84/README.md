## Overview

- Topics: Functions, list comprehensions, random module

### The challenge

- Build a text-based version of the Tic Tac Toe game. The game should be playable in the command line and should be a 2-player game, where one person is "X" and the other plays "O". Optional: Build an AI player to play the game with you.

## Notes
**Approach**
The project was a bit challenging and took a while to build. I started with the human player option and  was able to break it down by building the board, and create functions to update the board, check if there's a winner, and to alternate between the players. 
I got initially confused as to how to build the ai-human version, but was able to implement a similar code for it. I got a bit stuck with some errors and used chatGPT to help me figure out what was wrong or how to fix some parts.

**For Improvement:** 
There's a lot that I still need to improve. Things I still plan to work on:
1. Implement a way to identify a tie between players. 
2. Improve input validation
3. Error handling
4. Simplify the code more/refactor and 
5. Give an option for the player to play again.
6. Make a GUI version.

**Biggest learning:**
- I still make occasional simple beginner mistakes like forgetting to check type or converting with int() or str(). 
- It also helps to take a break because things start to get jumbled when you stare at the code too long. However, I am happy I got this far, especially when I compare to how I started, I never thought I could build something like this and it's great that I got it to function the way I wanted it to with the option for both human players, and a human-computer game. I still plan on coming back to my code to improve the areas that need improvement.
