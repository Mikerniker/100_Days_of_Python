- Had some syntax errors that were easy to miss. Example - missing parenthesis or parenthesis in the wrong place causing jinja errors. Also when displaying images, some minor syntax errors with quotation marks in the main file but was able to resolve them after some time.
- Also some parts of the tasks were unclear, some instructions mentioned adding author and dates, which were not part of the original files, so you had to manually add them yourself. Same with the post images, which you also added yourself, based on the comments of other course takers.
