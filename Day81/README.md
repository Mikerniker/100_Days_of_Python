###  Notes
- This was tougher than the other activities. Data science isn't my main interest nor is it my strongest suit. I had to refer to Angela's code for some sections of the exercise since I didn't fully understand how to approach the solution. I think I'll be sticking more to web development (Flask / Django etc/) rather than data science/analytics for the future.
